The Moomins was a TV show which I used to watch as a little kid in front of
the television. The Moomins I was looking at was the English version which was
dubbed to Dutch. The soundtrack by Graeme Miller & Steve Shill was made for the
Polish version of the Moomins which was made with stop-motion fuzzy-felt [validate]
animation. Moomins was created by .... and therefor has his origins in Finland.

The Moomins is being released for the first time by Finders Keepers records.
Graeme Miller & Steve Shill were first part of some theater group [?].

The opening track, which is the theme for the Moomins is a really sweet track
with these really melancholic overtones. It's supposed to be a good children's
track, but depending on your mood it can be interpreted as something really
haunting or something really sweet, which is something I personally really like.

I love these really sweet bits and pieces in between, like the Piano Waltz and
The Woodwind Band At A Distance.
