      2017 is almost over and what a blast it was. I'm going to give
      all of the readers and fine people that come here every now and
      then, a long status update containing the following:
      discreet anonymized data about my lovely little online record store
      <sr>https://www.discogs.com/seller/LorikeetRecords</sr>, ofcourse a
      top 10 of the records that came out this year, new years wishes,
      thank you notes and the plans for comming year.

    </i>
  </p>

  <strong>Gigs / Radio</strong>
  <p>
    First off: this year was my Red Light Radio debut. It was a great
    one hour with the good as always, great DJ and buddy: Eindbaas. You can check
    it out on my Mixcloud <sr>https://www.mixcloud.com/lorikeet/</sr> (they misspelled my name as Lori Keet but hey,
    that's how the cookie crumbles). Ofcourse I've fond memories of the
    Arribada night, Tropicalismo and Woodstock69 and hopefully
    we'll see a return next year?
  </p>

  <strong>Mixtapes</strong>
  <p>
    This year was also the year of expanding on the 7 existing
    mixtapes. I created 5 in total,
    ranging from New-age music to Bollywood funk, Telugu synths,
    to Turkish psych to even Halloween music.
    One of which is an actual physical mixtape called 'Soundcraft'.    It's a very, very limited edition of just 1 cassette. Wait
    till Discogs picks up on that item when I'm famous.
    All of them are to be found on my Mixcloud <sr>https://www.mixcloud.com/lorikeet/</sr>.
  </p>

  <strong>Discogs</strong>
  <p>
    I burned through a shit load of tape, bubble wrap and
    vinyl boxes, because my little mini baby online record store
    this year had a whopping 83 orders. This is nothing compared
    to a regular record store but still worth mentioning. I also
    submitted 109 <sr>https://www.discogs.com/contributions?user=LorikeetRecords</sr> new releases to the Discogs database and will
    probably continue to be adding releases in the next year
  </p>

  <strong>Top 10 of 2017</strong>
  <p>
    Now without further ado I'd like to present the best records
    that crossed my nose, eyes and ears in 2017. This means
    either released in
    2017, found in 2017 or re-released in 2017. This list is
    really, really hard (that's why there are so many honerable
    mentions). There has been so much amazing music
    that crossed my ears this years that it's really hard
    to make a good list, but here it goes:
  </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Don Cherry - Brown Rice (1975, EMI)
        <p>
          I actually discovered this track due to a mixtape
          that was released by the one and only Elijah Wood (yes,
          the one from Lord Of The Rings) and Zach Cowie
          <sr>https://www.mixcloud.com/TheVinylFactory/vf-mix-08-elijah-wood-zach-cowie-aka-wooden-wisdom/</sr>. I knew Don
          Cherry from name, but never took the chance to listen
          to his music. Then, along came 'Brown Rice', a track
          which I find to be the greatest combination of
          psychedelic music, spoken word and jazz one can find.
          What a piece of art. You'll also hear more and more
          detail, the more you listen to it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Lino Capra Vaccina - Antico Adagio (2017, Reissue, Die Schachtel Records)

        <p>
          This is a record of which I had a single mp3 track
          floating around of on my hard disk. The track being
          'Voce in XY' <sr>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d32LfEZaIs</sr> which I got from a compilation of music
          from the blog "Microphone In The Trees" <sr>http://calmintrees.blogspot.nl/</sr>. It sounded relatively modern to my ears,
          the minimal composition, the melody which could be put
          straight into any TV-show / movie, the amount of detail
          and little panning effects. The thing is that it was
          made in 1978 but sounds like it is from today.
          Originals are selling for huge numbers
          on Discogs so I'm glad Die Schachtel rereleased this
          so I can enjoy it for a relatively normal price.
        </p>

      <li>
        Nahid Akhtar - I Am Black Beauty (2017, Compilation, Reissue, Finders Keepers Records)

        <p>
          My personal heroes - Finders Keepers - doing what they
          do well, which is compiling amazing music. "I Am Black
          Beaty" is a compilaton of Pakistani singer
          Nahid Akhtar. It features tracks from composers such
          as M. Ashraf, Nazir Ali, Tafo Brothers which are a
          few of the households names if you're looking for any
          odd, psychedelic Pakistani music. The opening track for
          this record "Badami Nainon Wale" has such a badass
          fuzz guitar and that siren sound that whirls around
          throughout the song makes it almost sampleworthy for
          hip-hop artists <sr>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EIC1fyLcs</sr>.
          Other favorites are tracks like "Karye Par" and
          "Sheeshe Ki Botal" which was already featured on
          the "Life Is Dance" compilation from the same label,
          but it was a nice addition to this compilation.
        </p>

      <li>
        Ammar El Sheriyi - Music From The Songs Of Abdel Halim Hafez Played By Ammar El Sheriyi In His Own Style (1978, Soutelphan Records)
        <p>
          All credits go to Tutu Atrash in this matter, for
          posting one of the most electronic, yet psychedelic
          renditions of the music from Abdel Halim Hafez. The
          track is called 'Asmar Ya Asmarani' <sr>https://soundcloud.com/tutuatrash/omar-el-shairy-asmar-el-asmaran</sr>. What I
          like about it, is that it's almost an ideal fusion
          between traditional Arabic music, but keeping it hard
          and heavy with layers of electronics and weird effects.
          Above all I managed to find this on vinyl during the
          Utrecht record fair from my now favorite Belgian record
          dealers Radio Martiko.

    <strong>Next up!</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Next year is hopefully going to be even greater. I can already give away
    that I'll be playing Operator Radio in Rotterdam for 2 hours on the 20th
    of January between 12:00 and 14:00! So go check that out. I'll also be
    the support act for The Mauskovic Dance Band in a small but nice local
    place. I'm also planning on making a mixtape with just
    Eastern European music or one with just South-American
    cumbia's? Maybe both? Who knows!
