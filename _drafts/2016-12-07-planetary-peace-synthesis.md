  Planetary Peace is a husband and wife duo that moved from San Fransisco
  to London. They brought a (custom made? VALIDATE) analog synthesizer
  with them, as seen on the cover, and together they recorded this single
  tape, called 'Synthesis'. Because the analog synthesizer was custom made,
  the plane delayed their flight because they thought it might have been
  a possible bomb. The album itself is their only album and contains 19
  tracks varying in length, containing both instrumental and vocal
  compositions.

  To simply put it, this is new-age music. It has a high spritual
  atmosphere and most songs lyrical themes are about personality, religion, birth
  and the cosmos. The synths are really soothing and sweet, nothing
  is to harshly recorded and everything remains subtle and rather freeform.
  Because of that the sounds have a rather child-like tone to it. It could have
  been used as an intro for a 60s/70s kids tv-show remeniscant of Fingermouse,
  Dr Who or the Moomins for that matter. It also reminds me of groups like
  Peaking Lights and Lucky Dragons.

  TALK IN DETAIL ABOUT THE TRACKS, what do you like, what do you think could
  be better.
