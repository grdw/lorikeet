    This is a tape with one of those amazing stories. One that you can tell
    to a dedicated audience. That group of people that are interested
    in music, people that listen.

<p>
  Planetary Peace is a husband and wife duo that moved from San Fransisco
  to London. They brought a (custom made? VALIDATE) analog synthesizer
  with them, as seen on the cover, and together they recorded this single
  tape, called 'Synthesis'. Because the analog synthesizer was custom made,
  the plane delayed their flight because they thought it might have been
  a possible bomb.

  To simply put it, this is new-age music It has a high spritual
  atmosphere and most songs lyrical themese are about personality, religion, birth
  and the cosmos. The synths are really soothing and sweet, nothing
  is to harshly recorded and everything remains subtle. It has a
  rather child-like tone to it. It could have been used as an intro
  for a 60s/70s kids tv-show remeniscant of Fingermouse, Dr Who or
  the Moomins for that matter.
