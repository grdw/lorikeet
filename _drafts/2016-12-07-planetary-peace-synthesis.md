  Planetary Peace is a husband and wife duo that moved from San Fransisco
  to London. They brought a custom made analog synthesizer
  with them, as seen on the cover, and together they recorded this single
  tape, called 'Synthesis' on a Tael reel-to-reel tape recorder. Because the analog synthesizer was custom made,
  the plane delayed their flight because they thought it might have been
  a possible bomb. <a href='' target='_blank'>[1]</a> The album itself is their only album and contains 20 tracks varying in length, containing both instrumental and vocal
  compositions.

  To simply put it, this is new-age music. It has a high spritual
  atmosphere and most songs lyrical themes are about personality, religion, birth
  and the cosmos. The synths are really soothing and sweet, nothing
  is to harshly recorded and everything remains subtle and rather freeform.
  Because of that the sounds have a rather child-like tone to it. Most instrumentals
  could have been used as an intro for a 60s/70s kids tv-show remeniscant of Fingermouse,
  Dr Who or the Moomins for that matter. Other instrumentals sound more sinister
  and have a more 'dark' [? please find more subtle word] vibe.
  It also sounds similar to early Peaking Lights or Lucky Dragons.

  Like said, this album contains 20 tracks in total, which adds up to over
  an hour of music. Some songs sound coherent as a single piece, but overall
  there isn't a rather structured order in the tracks that I can discover.
  The songs that I really enjoyed listening to are 'Country Of Love'
  which is an 8 minute during etheral track which has this
  hauntingly nice synth/vocal in it. Another track I seem to really come
  back to is Hare Om which is a more darker track with
  a little bit of an oriental feel. That track bleeds in really nice
  with the following track 'Highland Memories'. The sounds are quiet lovely
  and unique due to the vocal harmonies and the fact that they used a completely
  hand-build analog synthesizer [duplicate info?].

  Some of the tracks on here are well past the 6 to 8 minute mark. This makes some
  of these tracks hard to get through, and a rather tough listen. Mainly because
  some of them can become rather repetitive and therefor boring. A song like [x]
  loses it's sense of passion a little bit after the 20th time hearing '<lyric>'.
  Stating that this record feels more like a compilation than a single coherent piece,
  it is rather easy to skip a track and don't loose the overall sustain of
  the music.

  Overall I really enjoy Synthesis by Planetary Peace. It's a gem uncovered
  from a yard sale and repressed to be enjoyed again for a limited audience
  (there are only 80 repressed copies) []. The songs were meant to be distributed
  among friends and coworkers, but because of Love All Day records a handful
  of people are going to be lucky owners. The music adds up to the mystical
  realm of new-age tapes that have been released all throughout the last 50
  years and it will have a rightful place among those records. Some songs
  really seem to grab my momentum while others lose that same vibe
  by being a little to flat to me. All in all it's enjoyable, sweet while
  simiatanousley (find spelling of this fucking word) being haunting.
  Weird vibes. <strong>[7.0/10]</strong>
