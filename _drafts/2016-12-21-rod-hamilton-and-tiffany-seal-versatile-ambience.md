    Somewhere while browsing on Bandcamp I managed to find a very peculiar
    tape. It was an ambient record purely based on repetition with marimba and
    xylophone sounds. The result is a very soothing, yet psychedelic mixture of
    sorts. The artist in this matter is Rod Hamilton and the name of the album is
    Atitl√°n <a href="https://rodhamilton.bandcamp.com/album/atitl-n-2" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
  </p>

    After ordering the cassette and assuming that next to "Teal" there weren't any
    other records of Rod Hamilton, I manage to find a second tape inside my
    package. This tape is the tape this article is going to review; "Versatile
    Ambience" by Rod Hamilton & Tiffany Seal.

  Rod Hamilton and Tiffany Seal are two musicians from Baltimore, Maryland.
  And 'Versatile Ambience", which is released by Ehse Records, is their first
  physical release they did together. There were some other songs
  they did together but they're only available from their Soundcloud page
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rod_and_tiffany" target="_blank">[2]</a>
  The music on this record can be described as improvisational, ambient, electronic.
  It also contains hints of field recordings and some spoken word.
</p>

<p>
  The top track of this record has to be the opening track 'Calico'. It has
  these intense fuzzy reverb over the xylophones and these hauntingly
  beautiful vocals after the 3 minute mark of the track. The melody is really
  great and progresses well along time. Another track I keep coming back to is
  'Petals' which uses this very simple loop but features some of the craziest
  modulated xylophone sounds, which are used as some sort of percussion instead
  of as a lead instrument.
</p>

<p>
  The thing I like less about the record is the cover art. It's a thing which
  doesn't really seem to match the music. It's a hand with a colorful rock in
  it. It feels a bit cheap; like they took a single picture and said: 'tada,
  there is the cover'. About the album as a whole there's a single track which
  I don't really particularly like and that's the last track on the A-side called
  'Golden Light'. It features these spoken word Yoga instructions, which
  feel a little cheesy. There's some modulation over the vocals but it doesn't
  really add something.
</p>

<p>
  Overall 'Versatile Ambiance' by Rod Hamilton & Tiffany Seal is a nice album
  to listen to. It features some very nice and relaxing tracks and some of the most
  creative use of xylophones and marimba's. The downside is that the cover art
  and some of the tracks feel a little sloppy and not well thought through.
  Because of that, you can really lose your sense of immersiveness, which for
  ambient music is a bit of a deal breaker. Like somebody
  who snaps his finger besides your ear and says: 'wake up'
  <strong>[5.5/10]</strong>.
