  <p>
    Somewhere while browsing on bandcamp I managed to find a very peculiar
    tape. It was an ambient record purely based on repetition with marimba and
    xylophone sounds. The result is a very soothing, yet psychedelic mixture of
    sorts. The artist in this matter is Rod Hamilton and the name of the album is
    Atitl√°n <a href="https://rodhamilton.bandcamp.com/album/atitl-n-2" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After ordering the cassette and assuming that next to "Teal" there weren't any
    other records of Rod Hamilton, I manage to find a second tape inside my
    package. This tape is the tape this article is going to review; "Versatile
    Ambience" by Rod Hamilton & Tiffany Seal.

<p>
  Rod Hamilton and Tiffany Seal are two musicians from Baltimore, Maryland.
  And 'Versatile Ambience", which is released by Ehse Records, is their first
  physical release. There were some other songs
  they did together but they're only available from their soundcloud page
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rod_and_tiffany" target="_blank">[2]</a>
  The music on this record can be described as improvisational, ambient, electronic.
  It also contains hints of field recordings and some spoken word.

<p>
  What do I like about this.

  - Calico (fuzzy, reverb over the xylophones, hauntingly beautiful vocals in
    after the 2 minute mark of the track, the melody is really mysterious and really
    progresses well)
</p>

<p>
  What don't I like.

  - cover art
  - golden light (track A5)
