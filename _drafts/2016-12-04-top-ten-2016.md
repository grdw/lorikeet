	<p>
		We're nearing the end of 2016 and what a year it has been!
		I hereby present to you, the list of lists of 2016, the top
		ten records I personally found to be the most enjoyable
		listens of this year. It's always hard to pick, but this has
		become the final list of lists (no backsies):
	</p>

	<h2>#10 - Heimat - Heimat</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Kill Shaman</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/10.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		The first time I heared about this record was through the user
		'dyingforbadmusic' on Bandcamp. The weakness I have for great/bad cover
		art is rather telling and after seeing the above image I had to know
		what the hell this was going to sound like. Turns out it's a post-punk,
		sampler, cold, german, baba ghanoush, and I like it!

	<h2>#9 - Jean-Bernard Raiteux - Les Demons</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Finders Keepers</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/9.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the greatest record reissueing labels of the last time, hits
		again. This time with the movie soundtrack to Les Demons.
		It's occult, jazz, psychedelic, library music - to a rather explicit
		movie - is something else entirely. A horror movie about burning
		witches, corruption, torture, depravity, all the things you don't
		really want to see with a soundtrack you want to hear.
	</p>

	<h2>#8 - Hailu Mergia & Dahlak Band - Wede Harer Guzo</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Awesome Tapes From Africa</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/8.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is Hailu Mergia's magical keyboard and accordeon playing combined
		with one of the finest bands of Ethiopia, the Dahlak Band. If I
		have the story correct, Brian from Awesome Tapes Of Africa, got
		this tape from Hailu Mergia himself. It was the only tape currently
		in his possession and through that tape, this record was created.
		The music itself is relaxing, slow, lo-fi, jazzy, synthesizer music,
		which really pushes the alienating sounds that come out of Ethiopia.

	<h2>#7 - Klaus Johann Grobe - Spagat Der Liebe</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Trouble In Mind</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/7.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		The Follow up to 2014's 'Im Sinne Der Zeit' takes a funky disco take on rock
		music. To really cheapily put the 'krautrock' sticker on this record
    feels a bit to easy. The synth-heavy, German-sung songs make it hard
		to keep those feet from standing still.
	</p>

	<h2>#6 - Loving - Loving</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Haju Tapes</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/6.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Released on an instrumental hip-hop label and discovered by
		'Buried Muse', Loving's shimmering love songs are somewhat
		reminiscent of Mac DeMarco's body of work. Tracks like "Forgot Again"
		and "Bowlly goes dancing drunk into the future" are really well
		written and nice to listen to. It makes up a lot of listens
		on rainy sunday afternoons and the cassette is proudly sitting on the
		shelf next to the others.

	<h2>#5 - Omni - Deluxe</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Trouble In Mind</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/5.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Omni's debut 'Deluxe' is without a doubt one of the finest post-punk
		records to come out this year. It's technically complex, it's mixed
		really smudgy, a little bit in the red at times and overall intense.
		The shear speed and eerie subjects of the lyrics make this record a
		very enjoyable listen.
	</p>

	<h2>#4 - Yishak Banjaw - Love Songs Vol. 2</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Teranga Beat</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/4.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to political situations in Ethiopia at the time, Yishak Banjaw's home recorded
		Love Songs Vol. 2, was delayed from seeing the light of day in other parts of the
		world for 30 years. This psychedelic, otherworldly, groovy jazz record gives you
		an extra dimension of the music of Ethiopia. This release stands out in the
		whole diversity of Ethiopian music I've managed to hear so far, purely due to
		it's experimental and psychedelic nature.
	</p>

	<h2>#3 - Monster Rally's - Mystery Cove</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Gold Robot</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/3.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		I started blogging about Monster Rally's endavours back in 2011 when
		his first cassettes started to pop-up on bandcamp. Now his sound is
		more refined, more polished but it retains it's exotic, glistening
		subtle-glitchy tone. Mystery Cove makes it hard not to imagine that
		you're on an island trying to fetch a coconut from a palm tree.

	<h2>#2 - Kikagaku Moyo - House In The Tall Grass</h2>
	<div>
		<i>Guruguru Brain</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/2.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Kikagaku Moyo; I saw them live for the first time in Liverpool
		this year and my response was to buy this album. It's a dream
		pop, psychedelic record with really soothing guitar work and
		singing. It's a really sweet, chill, nice record which works
		like a good cup of tea to a stressfull day.
	</p>

	<h2>#1 - The Caretaker - Everywhere At The End Of Time</h2>
	<div>
		<i>History Always Favours The Winners</i>
	</div>
	<p>
		<img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/1.jpg"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the number one of 2016 for me; no questions asked. This record
		is an extensions to the ode The Caretaker is giving, to the ballroom
		scene of The Shining. He'll do another 5 albums of these and I can't
		wait to hear everyone of them. The mood, the overall vibe, the
		nostalgic feelings, the haunting beauty - it's all in here.
