  Coming december the 16th I'll do a full African DJ set in one of our local
  taverns called "De Odeon" in Alkmaar. As a little promotion I'll be doing
  a live set this weekend on saturday. Please tune in to my website and you'll
  here the greatest Ethiopian jazz, crazy funk rhythms from Madagascar, Afro-cuban
  tracks from Angola, dance hits from Nigeria. It will be the last show I'll
  perform as 'Beardy Maria', from than on I'll just use 'Lorikeet' as my DJ
  alias and stick with that for the time being.

  Until then, lots of love<br/>
