  Y2017:
    - artist: Don Cherry
      title: Brown Rice
      released: 1976
      label: EMI

        I actually discovered the title-track of this record due to a mixtape
        that was released by the one and only Elijah Wood (yes,
        the one from Lord Of The Rings) and Zach Cowie
        <sr>https://www.mixcloud.com/TheVinylFactory/vf-mix-08-elijah-wood-zach-cowie-aka-wooden-wisdom/</sr>. I knew Don
        Cherry from name, but never took the chance to listen
        to his music. Then, along came 'Brown Rice', a track
        which I find to be the greatest combination of
        psychedelic music, spoken word and jazz one can find.
        What a piece of art. You'll also hear more and more
        detail, the more you listen to it.

      title: Antico Adagio
      released: "2017, Reissue"
      label: Die Schachtel Records

        This is a record of which I had a single mp3 track
        floating around of on my hard disk. The track being
        'Voce in XY' <sr>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d32LfEZaIs</sr> which I got from a compilation of music
        from the blog "Microphone In The Trees" <sr>http://calmintrees.blogspot.nl/</sr>. It sounded relatively modern to my ears,
        the minimal composition, the melody which could be put
        straight into any TV-show / movie, the amount of detail
        and little panning effects. The thing is that it was
        made in 1978 but sounds like it is from today.
        Originals are selling for huge numbers
        on Discogs so I'm glad Die Schachtel re-released this
        so I can enjoy it for a relatively normal price.

      title: I Am Black Beauty
      released: "2017, Compilation, Reissue"
      label: Finders Keepers Records
      cover: "/img/2017/12/05.jpg"
      description: |
        My personal heroes - Finders Keepers - doing what they
        do well, which is compiling amazing music. "I Am Black
        Beauty" is a compilation of Pakistani singer
        Nahid Akhtar. It features tracks from composers such
        as M. Ashraf, Nazir Ali, Tafo Brothers which are a
        few of the households names if you're looking for any
        odd, psychedelic Pakistani music. The opening track for
        this record "Badami Nainon Wale" has such a badass
        fuzz guitar and that siren sound that whirls around
        throughout the song makes it almost sample-worthy for
        hip-hop artists <sr>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EIC1fyLcs</sr>.
        Other favorites are tracks like "Karye Par" and
        "Sheeshe Ki Botal" which was already featured on
        the "Life Is Dance" compilation from the same label,
        but it was a nice addition to this compilation.

      title: "Sweet As Broken Dates: Lost Somali Tapes From The Horn Of Africa"
      released: "2017, Compilation, Reissue"
      label: Ostinato Records
      cover: "/img/2017/12/07.jpg"
      description: |
        This record got me really excited this year. After the TED talk by Ostinato Records founder
        Vik Sohonie <sr>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EaZXFEaeI4</sr>
        and the amazing mixtape on Soundcloud <sr>https://soundcloud.com/ostinatorecords/somali-sounds-from-mogadishu-to-djibouti-selected-by-nicolas-sheikholeslami-vik-sohonie></sr> that accompanied the hype surrounding this release,
        I went straight to the record store once it hit the shelves. I find it amazing to
        hear that there's such great music to be found in a country of which relatively, at least
        music wise, not much is known about. I used two tracks from this compilation (Dur-Dur Band with Gorof (Elixir) and
        4 Mars with Na Daadihi (Guide Us)) on the
        Red Light Radio show <sr>https://www.mixcloud.com/RedLightRadio/eindbaas-lori-keet-red-light-radio-11-09-2017/</sr> I did
        with Eindbaas.

      released: 2017
      label: Nonsuch Records
      cover: "/img/2017/12/08.jpg"
      description: |
        This record was gifted to me on my birthday. As a bit of a Fleet Foxes fan I honestly think that
        Fleet Foxes has taken a step further in their music with this newest record. Again Robert Pecknold
        manages to deliver those really amazing, typical vocals and this definitely feels like a step forward,
        musically, compared to their previous record Helplessness Blues. I also feel that they really think intensely
        about what they're making and why they're making it (which is probably why it takes so long for
        them to make a record). All in all, go listen to it if you haven't already.

    - artist: Colin Stetson
      title: All This I Do For Glory
      released: 2017
      label: 52Hz
      cover: "/img/2017/12/09.jpg"
      description: |
        'All This I Do For Glory' is the 8th Colin Stetson album and he is pushing the boundaries of
        saxophone/horn playing again. When seeing him play live, together with Sarah Neufield, in 2015 for the
        first time I was initially skeptical. I was skeptical in the sense of: 'How can a saxophone player keep a whole
        show interesting?' Turns out, he can. If you see his energy, the way his cheeks swell up during
        playing, how his oxygen almost runs out and the intensity which with he performs, it makes you doubt for a moment
        if this guy is even human. One thing I didn't doubt about was that I became a fan after that performance.
        With this new release, he recorded the tracks in single takes with no overdubs, much like his previous 'New
        History Warfare'-series. But one thing is clear: that I love this record. It features everything I liked on
        previous records: the hard-hitting Saxophone percussion, the 'throat-mic' screaming sound - which sounds
        like a dying alien creature, his breathing in the background and an amazing diversity and mastery of his
        instrument.

    - artist: The Caretaker
      title: "Everywhere At The End Of Time - Stage 2"
      released: 2017
      label: History Always Favours The Winners
      cover: "/img/2017/12/10.jpg"
      description: |
        This year brought forth 2 of the 6 part series 'Everywhere At The End Of Time' which brings the total
        to 3 for now. It's The Caretaker's final project before James Leyland Kirby will be putting an end to it's alias
        The Caretaker. Last year I reviewed the first stage very positively <sr>/2016/09/30/the-caretaker-everywhere-at-the-end-of-time.html</sr>
        and it was actually the first article on the Lorikeet blog. With this project sound-designer and artist The Caretaker uses these series
        to explain dementia through sound, in a 6 part series. The music of which is actually deteriorating over time. You can
        definitely hear that happening between Stage 2 and Stage 3. On Stage 2 the music is grasping back to compositions of Stage 1.
        Stage 3 is even so bold to go back to one of The Caretaker's previous releases and take samples from much appraised:
        'An Empty Bliss Beyond This World'. Probably as a musical metaphor to some long lost recall to something in the past.
        The fact that I picked Stage 2 and not Stage 3 is the fact that Stage 2 is a little more accessible. The skips aren't that abrupt
        or the noise to overwhelming over the beautiful, slowed down and manipulated ballroom jazz samples.

      title: Music From The Songs Of Abdel Halim Hafez Played By Ammar El Sheriyi In His Own Style
      released: 1978

      description: |
        All credits go to Tutu Atrash in this matter, for
        posting one of the most electronic, yet psychedelic
        renditions of the music from Abdel Halim Hafez. The
        track is called 'Asmar Ya Asmarani' <sr>https://soundcloud.com/tutuatrash/omar-el-shairy-asmar-el-asmaran</sr>. What I
        like about it, is that it's almost an ideal fusion
        between traditional Arabic music, but keeping it hard
        and heavy with layers of electronics and weird effects.
        Above all I managed to find this on vinyl during the
        Utrecht record fair from my now favorite Belgian record
        dealers Radio Martiko.

        The maestro, the one-and-only, the man of 900 soundtracks: Ilaiyaraaja. This year I came across a lot of
        this guy's music while collecting South-Indian soundtracks. Of course my introduction to this man came from
        the Solla-Solla release by Finders Keepers back in 2015. This release can be seen as a compilation of his
        most crazy, out-there music. Unfortunately I think Finders Keepers have to admit that they forgot about
        some of the crazy tracks. On this particular release are two tracks which blew me away. The first track being:
        Zindabaad, sung by S.P. Balasubrahmanyam & Chitra - which features this amazing, driving electronic beat. The other
        track being - one of my current favorites of Ilaiyaraaja: Iddarathivala by S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, Chitra & S. Janaki.
        This track has such an amazing build-up, this great upbeat tempo, great production and all of a sudden turns into
        'Focus - Hocus Pocus'-type-crazy in a break. <br/><br/>

        This particular track actually started a lovely 'bonding' between me and Vintage Voudou records. I knew about
        'Fire Star', a compilation which was made with more electronic music from Ilaiyaraaja which is compiled by
        the shop owner of Vintage Voudou and a few Telugu/Tamil-soundtrack mixtapes he made for Red Light Radio.
        A few emails later and listening to this song in his store, I somehow - a few weeks later - ended up in his
        working space, sifting through 100's of records by Ilaiyaraaja. Occasionally he let's me take a few home which
        results in some amazing finds and discoveries and the occasional funny cover-art on my Instragram profile.

      description: |
        The USSR, the time of communism, the time where Мелодия (Melodiya) was one of the only labels where you could put
        your music out if you were a musician living in the area. When the USSR collapsed, this label became
        no longer state-owned. This now Russian non-state-owned label has put out
        everything actually: from classical music, to James Brown to The Beatles, to jazz, to experimental electronic
        music, you name it. This particular release is a fusion record called Утро Земли (which transliterates to Utro
        Zemli) by Джазовый Ансамбль Игоря Бриля (Igor Bril Jazz Ensemble). I discovered this release on the Youtube
        page of user Funked Up East <sr>https://www.youtube.com/user/mishapanfilov</sr> which is actually owned by
        Misha Panfilov. A guy who actually makes music himself under his alias 'Misha Panfilov Sound Combo' and plays
        in a jazz band called: Estrada Orchestra.
        This release is a bit of a weird beast, it features these really great, quite lengthy instrumental jazz-funk
        tracks in combination with classical-sounding piano music? The odd combination actually goes really well.
        I particularly like the tracks: 'Улица Без Конца' and 'Балканский Орнамент'.
