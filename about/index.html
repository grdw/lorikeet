    <strong>Info</strong>
    <p>
      "A Lorikeet is a small to medium sized arboreal parrot. The majority
      have very brightly coloured plumage."
    </p>

  <p>
    Lorikeet is a DJ-alias, a record store and a blog started by Gerard Westerhof
    (ex-Drunken Marias, ex-Kofferbaque). With this project he will try to
    invite others to explore the wonderful, the obscure, the oriental, the odd;
    groovy sounds to amaze.
  </p>

  <p>
   He's looking for the sounds from the east and the warm south.
   Tropical, exotic, distorted atmospheres in a funky / jazzy jacket. Records like
   you might have never heard before.
