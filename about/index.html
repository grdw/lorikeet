    "A Lorikeet is a small to medium sized arboreal parrot. The majority
    have very brightly coloured plumage."

    Lorikeet is a vinyl DJ project and a blog started by Gerard Westerhof
    (ex-Drunken Marias, ex-Kofferbaque). With this DJ project he will try to
    explore the wonderful, the obscure, the oriental, the odd; sounds to amaze.
