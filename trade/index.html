    Currently I've been selling close to 200 orders on Discogs and thought
    it would be nice to introduce people to the things I've been
    selling. All these items on this page, are for trade.
    (Read more by scrolling down).

    If you however want something collectable and special, than I'm
    probably selling it on Discogs:

    If you want any of these items, the following rules apply:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      All these items are for trade, not for sale.
    </li>
    <li>
      I trade for something equal in value and only if it's of interest to us both.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a href="https://www.postnl.nl/tarieven/tarieven-pakketten/" target="_blank">shipment costs</a>
      are the things you have to pay yourself, depending on who needs to spend
      the most on it.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Send me an email: <a href="mailto:bird@lorikeet.nl">bird{at}lorikeet.nl</a>
    and tell me a little bit about why you want this
    record and where it needs to ship to. Introduce me to a record you'd like
    to send me in exchange and perhaps we'll have a nice trade. Depending on the
    shipment costs I'll pay or you'll pay the difference preferably through Paypal.
    If you
    live in the direct neighborhood, know who I am and where I live, than you
    can obviously come and get it without any of the shipment costs.
