  <p>
    All these items are for trade. I'm not selling them! I'll trade for
    something equal in value or something I'm interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course I'm also selling some things but those records aren't as special
    as the one's on this page.

  <p>
    If you want any of these items, the following rules apply:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      All these items are for trade, not for sale.
    </li>
    <li>
      I trade for something equal in value and only if it's of interest to us both.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a href="https://www.postnl.nl/tarieven/tarieven-pakketten/" target="_blank">shipment costs</a>
      are the things you have to pay yourself, depending on who needs to spend
      the most on it.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Send me an email: <a href="mailto:bird@lorikeet.nl">bird{at}lorikeet.nl</a>
    and tell me a little bit about why you want this
    record and where it needs to ship to. Introduce me to a record you'd like
    to send me in exchange and perhaps we'll have a nice trade. Depending on the
    shipment costs I'll pay or you'll pay the difference preferably through Paypal.
    If you
    live in the direct neighborhood, know who I am and where I live, than you
    can obviously come and get it without any of the shipment costs.
