Recently I did a redesign of the website. I found a lot of the colors
to kitchy and it was a little bit to jolly. My music tastes are also shifting
a little during the course of my DJ 'career' and my life recently. The biggest focus
this year was obviously Pakistani music <sr>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE03WcWIqhfB5uc0KWHIw0g/videos</sr>, that's why the subtitle of the logo
is in Urdu; translating roughly to the word 'Lorikeet'. I still keep the bird
visuals but just as drawings and not as much with colors.

The reason for the shift to a more minimal, folky look is because that's where
my own musical interests are moving towards. With the Radio Tempo Nao PÃ¡ra sit down session
I did <sr>https://soundcloud.com/radiotemponaopara/the-middle-east-sit-down-session-by-lorikeet-club-atelier-x-radio-tnp</sr>
and the DJ sets for Mehmet Polat and Sonic Boom this year I feel the focus is going more
towards jazz, folk, electronic minimalism. That doesn't mean I'm excluding the
other routes I previously went into, but I would like to delve a bit more deeper
into those areas of music and hopefully write a bit more about my findings on
this blog.

I will still do an end of the year review of all the music that has crossed
my ears this year, but more on that later.
