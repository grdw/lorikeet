<div class="intro">
  <p>
  I sit alone in a place I can't quite remember the name of. The waiter
  passes by, not noticing the older man sitting three tables across, trying
  very hard to raise his hand and draw attention. Purely judging by the gray
  shade of color the mist is producing outside and due to the inability to
  look outside of the foggy window, it must be somewhere around October.
  </p>
  <p>
  "Here's the wine you ordered sir" says a tall man with a rather hazy, yet
  sophisticated English accent.
  <br/>
  - "Thanks"
  </p>
  <p>
  I look across the tables and bar stools, but the place is a bit quiet and
  empty. Apart from the old man who's still trying to grab the attention of
  the waiter, the bar personnel and three rather drunk men, there's nobody
  else. Must be the time of day I think to myself.
  <br/>
  '4 am' I see on the old wooden clock on the wall.
  </p>
  <p>
  While having moved my eyes from the tables, to the clock, I rest them
  upon an empty looking stage with nothing but the piano still there. The
  band must have already left. I take a small sip from my wine and I start
  to wonder what they sounded like. "I must have seen them play", I think
  to myself but I can't seem to remember what they played nor what they
  sounded like.
  </p>
  <p>
  While trying to remember, bits of sound come back to me: some horn
  section, soft piano key strokes. It's vague, distant at first, than it
  slowly fades in and I start to remember. I close my eyes and re-imagine
  the whole event as it took place, for as it seems to me, just a few
  moments ago.
  </p>
  <p>
  The sound of mumbling and the smell of anticipation was in the air. The
  bar is looking full and people are waiting and nervously drinking their
  drinks. The band members are individually tuning their instruments. A
  young man is closing the door of the bar, taking off his high hat and
  black coat and apologizes for being late.
  "They haven't started yet." The waiter whispers loudly to the man.
  He quietly takes a seat and waits for the band to start.
  </p>
  <p>
  Without notice they start playing. Everybody stops talking and gasps at
  what they're hearing.

The Caretaker's Everywhere At The End Of Time <a href="https://thecaretaker.bandcamp.com/album/everywhere-at-the-end-of-time" target="_blank">[1]</a>
is the first part of six records that will come out in the course of three
years. The six records will sadly sum up to become the final art piece for
The Caretaker project. The man behind it all, James Leyland Kirby, will put out
a record once every 6 months, "to sense time passing"
<a href="http://thequietus.com/articles/20970-leyland-james-kirby-interview-the-caretaker" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
Using old 78RPM jazz records he creates an atmosphere of a time long gone;
vanished. The theme of Caretaker's music is and has always been dementia and
memory loss. The theme itself is rather unsettling, yet it can also be
interpreted with a sense of beauty. Not knowing something which you actually
already knew once before, might be experienced as something nice. In these 6
records the process of dementia will be expressed through manipulation and
modulation of certain types of sound. This project will start out easily
listenable and slightly modulated and it will build up towards something which
sounds how someone with memory loss might experience it. However that may sound
like. The music in the first part of this project, which we're going to
discuss, sounds in many ways similar to previous albums The Caretaker has put
out. "An Empty Bliss Beyond This World"
<a href="https://thecaretaker.bandcamp.com/album/an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world" target="_blank">[3]</a>
from 2011 comes up and the previous album - the soundtrack to the documentary
with the same name - "Patience (After Sebald)"
<a href="https://thecaretaker.bandcamp.com/album/patience-after-sebald" target="_blank">[4]</a>,
which was released in 2012.

The music is like said, really atmospheric. It sets a certain aesthetic, which
commemorates the 1920s. Ballroom jazz as though it comes out of an old movie
projector. It's haunting, yet beautiful and it lives up very well to his
previous records. In line of the theme of dementia, I love the sudden endings
in some of the tracks. For example in the opening track "It's Just A Burning Memory"
and one of my favorites "Childish Fresh Eyes". It sounds as though someone just
forgot how it was supposed to end or if someone is jumping from one memory to
the next. The modulation on some of these recordings are subtle, it's a bit
less extreme than some of the final tracks on "An Empty Bliss Beyond This World".
Of course we have the crackling noises of a 78RPM record, the additional reverb
and some very nice touches of delay here and there. It doesn't get to noisy or
to distorted, yet.

The first part of Everywhere At The End Of Time sounds in many ways similar to
The Caretaker's previous endeavors but slightly more subtle. I personally enjoy
it a bit better if the sounds aren't all to distorted and brittle. My favorite
tracks on this album are definitely "Childish Fresh Eyes" and
"Quiet Internal Rebellions". It's a great follow up to the previous Caretaker
albums and I am really curious about what the next 5 albums will sound like.
Will it be more distorted? More mangled? Will the old black and white, ballroom
jazz vibe still be present? Only time will tell. Everywhere At The End Of Time
is full of lovely, soothing, haunting music that will grow a more and more
detailed imaginative image of what the 1920s might have been like to someone
who never experienced it <b>[8/10]</b>.
