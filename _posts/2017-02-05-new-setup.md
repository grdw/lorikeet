  Here I'm showing off with my new record boxes. They're
  pretty amazing and are quiet the tower; also it shows that
  I have a record buying 'problem'. Luckily you can make the
  problem a bit less by <a href="https://www.discogs.com/seller/LorikeetRecords/profile" target="_blank">buying some records</a> of me.
</p>

<strong>In other news .. </strong>
<p>
  I expect to have a lot of Turkish singles soon. Bought straight
  from Turkey through
  <a href="https://www.matarailgievi.com/" target="_blank">
    this wonderful webshop.
  </a>. Hopefully I'll write about it in another crate digging episode.
</p>

<p>
  In the mean time I decided to redesign the website a little bit and
  start getting a bit more graphical; I hope you enjoy the birds. Ofcourse
  my main source of inspiration are the album covers and art of
  <a href="https://monsterrally.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Monster Rally</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Also I'm trying to get together with some local DJ's
  and try to see if we can establish events together which seems rather
  cool to do. Hopefully I can announce more about that any time soon.
</p>

<p>
  These are all the random news flashes for now and until the next
  random news flash!
