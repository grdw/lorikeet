<p>Dear people (hopefully music lovers / listeners),</p>

<p>
  I sell some of my music on vinyl from time to time on Discogs.
  However, Discogs had a recent crackdown on bootleg records
  <sr>https://thevinylfactory.com/features/do-bootlegs-matter-what-discogs-new-crackdown-means-for-future/</sr>.
  For people who don't know what they are: bootlegs are records
  which are unofficially released without the artists consent or
  label's consent for that matter. I have 10 bootlegs, which I had
  for sale. Discogs found that inappropriate to do. I agree.
</p>

<p>
  Because of the fact that I can't sell them on Discogs, I tried
  selling them on another platform called Marktplaats, a Dutch
  trading website. That felt even more disgusting (and vinyl people
  aren't on Marktplaats apparently). A bootleg is still something
  illegal, but it exists already. I understand the hatred
  towards it in the community; that there are record labels that make
  money behind the back of artists that put blood, sweat and tears
  into their music. I find it to be stealing food out of the artists
  mouth and a form of theft. In another way I also find it's making
  the artist's music more known, even though it is through an illegal
  bootleg.
</p>

<strong>Enough opinions already!</strong>

<p>
  The problem still remains that I have 10 bootleg records laying
  around which I don't particularly like anymore; bought in a rush or
  got boring over time. I feel that I can't ask any money for
  these records, for the artist in question wouldn't get any of it
  anyway. So for the sake of doing a bit of justice to the bootleg
  record and feeling a little like Santa: I'm giving them away for free,
  so â‚¬0,- - much like the value of an illegally downloaded mp3. I do
  have conditions for giving them away:
</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The max is two per person
    </li>
    <li>
      The shipment costs are the things you have to pay yourself,
      because I do still support my local postal company.
    </li>
    <li>Don't be a dick:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If I find out that you only want these records so you can sell them yourself,
          than you are a dick.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you however - in time - find that the music is getting a bit
          boring, give them away to somebody else for free. That would
          make you a first class hero.
        </li>
