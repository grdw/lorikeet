If Suicide and Hailu Mergia had a love baby it would probably sound
something like Yishak Banjaw's endeavors on Love Songs Vol. 2. Yishak
Banjaw is a keyboard player from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Of course the first
album release that pops up in my head when somebody says "Ethiopia", it is this
years reissue of Hailu Mergia and Dahlak Band's, Wede Harer Guzo from
Awesome Tapes Of Africa <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Hailu-Mergia-Dahlak-Band-Wede-Harer-Guzo/release/8662288" target="_blank">[1]</a>. Yishak Banjaw's release however
weirdly enough, also reminds me of Suicide, Late Ramasar â€“ The Greatest
Name That Lives, some hints of Sun Ra, maybe even
William Onyeabor in some way and also Mamman Sani Abdoulaye's, Unreleased Tapes comes up.

Love Songs Vol. 2 was initially released on a cassette in 1986 but due to
the political climate in Ethiopia, it never saw the light of day in other
regions of the world. Because of this release Yishak was forbidden to travel
outside of his country and even inside of his own country. Love Songs Vol. 2
is therefor going to be Yishak Banjaw's first international release which is being put
out by record label Teranga Beat.

In recent years I've heard and seen a few reissues, compilations
and new music from Ethiopian bands and artists. It all sounds so otherworldly
compared to any other music which I'm familiar with; this release in particular.
Yishak Banjaw has influences ranging from jazz music to Arabic rhythms and somehow
manages to blend it with a very catchy, minimal and groovy drum machine sound.
The Arabic vibes are well present in songs like "Fikrehoy Temekeri", "Yadah" and
the closing track "Engudaye Nesh". Other tracks sounds somewhat similar to
Hailu Mergia, like "Segno Sra Allabign" and "Gwal Semahria". Because of the
combination - drum machine and keyboard experimentation - the music becomes
really danceable, while still being interesting to the ears for somebody with
a more jazzy taste. The music is also interesting from a psychedelic point of
view, due to the use "filter/wah-wah-a-like" effect over the keys.
The main sound of the keyboard is a typical Arabic-like sound and when that filter
effect fades in, the sound can become rather noisy, squeezed together, and turns into an
almost fuzz-like sound. I love those transitions, the melodies he plays,
and the overall feeling of this record. It sounds really warm, while still having a
bit of an cold aesthetic due to the minimal drum machine sounds.
It's the type of music of what I would imagine an Ethiopian nightclub might play.

Due to political situations in Ethiopia at the time, Yishak Banjaw's home recorded
Love Songs Vol. 2, was delayed from seeing the light of day in other parts of the
world for 30 years. This psychedelic, otherworldly, groovy jazz record gives you
an extra dimension of the music of Ethiopia. The warmth of the record and the mood
it puts you in, is really something else entirely. My personal favorites from this
record thus far are: "Ageren Ayehuwat" and "Yadah". This release stands out in the
whole diversity of Ethiopian music I've managed to hear so far, purely due to
it's experimental and psychedelic nature. It's the Ethiopian sound re-invented and
pushed beyond it's limits, 30 years to late. <b>[7+/10]</b>
