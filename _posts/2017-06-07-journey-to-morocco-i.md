    This is going to be a long piece of text, so be prepared. Finding
    music on vinyl in Morocco is not easy,  This article will present my
    finds and it will hopefully serve as a guide for other
    people who are trying to find music. It contains my experiences and
    locations which might serve useful for future travelers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let me start with the beginning. I never listened to much Moroccan music
    before somewhere around late 2015. I encountered the sounds on some
    mixtapes and enjoyed it, but I had no idea who was
    playing or
    what the song titles were. Than somewhere around 2016 a Belgian
    label called Radio Martiko reissued a record from Abdou El Omari
    called Nuits D'Ete

    <sr>https://soundcloud.com/radio-martiko/rmlp-001-nuits-dete-avec-abdou-el-omari-afrah-el-maghreb</sr>.

    A psychedelic, organ heavy record which I
    very much enjoyed. The echoes on the drums and all the weird
    effects makes it a very enjoyable listening experience. In that
    same year a German label reissued a record by Nass El Ghiwane

    <sr>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kmV1wivlsg'</sr>.

    A bit more traditional Moroccan sounding but enjoyable nonetheless.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mixtapes and those two records got me wondering what more can be
    unearthed from Morocco?
    To that question I wanted to find an answer. A lot of people
    went before me, but the information on the internet is really slim.
    I did find these articles:

    <sr>http://psychfunk.com/features/crate-digging-morocco-fes-casablanca/</sr>
    <sr>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/letter-from-morocco-casablanca-records</sr> and others which are listed furthermore in this
    article.
  </p>

  <strong>Off we go ... </strong>
  <p>
    I traveled to Morocco and started out in Casablanca. I started there
    because Abdou El Omari's music is from Casablanca. In fact, his music
    is reissued from Disques Gam

    <sr>https://www.google.com/maps/place/99+Boulevard+de+Paris,+Casablanca+20250,+Morocco/@33.5931058,-7.6215903,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xda7d29b1d24c911:0x9db70758bd6ccf90!2sBoulevard+de+Paris,+Casablanca+20250,+Morocco!3b1!8m2!3d33.5931014!4d-7.6194016!3m4!1s0xda7d29c79ca0af1:0xadde6c5eb817e19b!8m2!3d33.5922315!4d-7.6168929</sr>,

    which is still a record store you can
    visit in Casablanca itself. I went and things were a bit different
    than any normal record store you'd visit in Europe. To start off,
    nothing is priced. The next odd thing you'll notice is that all the
    records are behind glass cabinets, chained off or hung from the
    ceiling.
  </p>
  <p>
    My experience in Disques Gam was not a positive one. As I've managed
    to read somewhere online, the man behind the record
    store (Gam Boujemma) is not keen on people just touching his records and
    is very, very protective about them. You
    have to know <i>exactly</i> what you're looking for or else you can
    just get out of the door. Me, being a more exploring and digging type
    of character, this was not what I was expecting. I looked around and
    eventually the man in the store grunts (in French) something along
    the lines of: "what are you doing here?!". It took me a moment to
    understand what he asked because my French is pretty poor. Than I
    proceeded to touch a bunch of records and he got quite angry, and
    pointed me out of his store with the magical French word "sortie!".
    And I do know what that means.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that disappointing experience at Disques Gam I tried to find
    Le Comptoir Marocain de Distribution de Disques

    <sr>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Avenue+Lalla+Yacout,+Casablanca+20250,+Morocco/@33.5907286,-7.6156143,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xda7d29b1d24c911:0x9db70758bd6ccf90!2sBoulevard+de+Paris,+Casablanca+20250,+Morocco!3b1!8m2!3d33.5931014!4d-7.6194016!3m4!1s0xda7d29de2c09673:0x36b61f70c9ae40a7!8m2!3d33.5902195!4d-7.6120837</sr>

    which is a bit
    further down the road. I managed to find it, but unfortunately it
    was closed due to the fact that I was visiting Morocco during the
    Ramadan. That was a bummer.

  </p>

  <p>
    The next stop was trying the medinas, which are the old market
    places and city centers in most Moroccan places. Stating that
    I was in Casablanca, I tried the old medina

    <sr>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ancienne+Medina,+Casablanca+20250,+Morocco/@33.6009926,-7.6258712,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xda7d29b1d24c911:0x9db70758bd6ccf90!2sBoulevard+de+Paris,+Casablanca+20250,+Morocco!3b1!8m2!3d33.5931014!4d-7.6194016!3m4!1s0xda7d2842753b1cf:0xd872188d7a277139!8m2!3d33.6022285!4d-7.6209108</sr>

    of Casablanca first.
    Lots of stallholders will try to persuade you to buy something in
    their store, knock-off Western products, food, merchandise, cheaply
    build ouds and all the stuff you don't really want. I walked out of
    the medina with nothing and I lost my spirit a little bit.
  </p>
  <strong>Sigh...</strong>
  <p>
    I tried to get help, because this is harder than what I prepared for.
    I asked people on Reddit (on /r/vinyl

    <sr>https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/6ffoq6/as_a_tourist_in_morocco_where_would_i_find_vinyl/?st=j3uhylrn&sh=a2709f63</sr>

     and /r/Morocco/

    <sr>https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/6ey6om/weekly_thread_for_travel_related_questions/died3fq/</sr>) if they
    had any tips or hints on how to find music in Morocco. And it turns
    out one of the easiest way is apparantly showing a man in a souk
    (the term for one of the market stalls) on the medina a picture of
    vinyl and ask where they can be found. It turns out that for me
    (a non-Arabic speaking, severely poor-French speaking man),
    this was the way to do it. A typical Moroccan haggler navigated me
    through the maze of small streets and souks and got me to a small
    stand with an older looking, white male, who sold cassettes - at
    first glance (it turns out the man is the same person in
    this picture:

    <sr>https://www.thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/digging2.png</sr>).

    I than proceeded to show the picture of the records
    and it turns out that he had a lot of 7 inches. I couldn't listen
    to any of them, so I bought a stack of sixteen 7 inches purely based
    upon an arbitrary combination of pictures, names (like Nass El Ghiwane),
    record label (Boussiphone, Koutoubiaphone) and quality of the records.
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt like I was a lucky man and greed got a bit of the best of me.
    The next day, I tried to find other shops in the medina of
    Casablanca. I found one other souk, who sold mainly cassettes and
    some records on the ground. Most records were Bollywood 7
    inches, which were fairly easy to get and lots of Western music.
    I did found one Farid El-Atrache 7 inch which I haven't seen
    before, which might be cool. The quality was good enough and
    for 5 Dhm (which is &euro;0.50) I got another record. There was
    nothing else in the medina as far as I could find, but maybe somebody
    else has some tips for a future visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    My next stop was in Tangier. After a tremendous 6 hour train ride
    in the blazing heat (with a little bit of air conditioning, I
    must say) I arrived in Tangier. Because of the Ramadan I refrained
    from eating in front of the general population because it is
    considered to be rude. Hungry and tired I arrived in Tangier and
    started reading what other people have found in this city vinyl-wise.
    Unfortunately there isn't much information to be found on the
    internet. The only lead I had was a clock-maker right outside
    the medina
    who happens to sell some records

    <sr>https://jewishmorocco.blogspot.com/2012/11/record-digging-cassette-collecting-and.html</sr>
    <sr>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+Nasiria,+Tanger,+Morocco/@35.7858934,-5.8120909,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd0c7f527f923205:0x746edd383fc74e92!8m2!3d35.7858923!4d-5.8115437</sr>.

    The man in the article also
    visited during the Ramadan and I was also out of luck. He had some
    records on display that were very discolored by the sunlight and
    that was it. There was another place that sold records

    <sr>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+San+Francisco,+Tanger,+Morocco/@35.7842848,-5.8156549,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd0c7f52cb762073:0xffd425c6556141c!8m2!3d35.7841482!4d-5.8141695</sr>

    right next to the mosque at Place du 9 avril 1947.
    He had the standard Western thrift store sounds: 70s and 80s disco,
    funk and soul music and classical
    music, which wasn't what I was looking for. On the medina I did find
    lots of places that sold CD's and a few that sold cassettes. But
    vinyl is not a thing you would find easily in Tangier. I should
    probably have headed out for Fez.
  </p>

  <strong>My finds:</strong>
  <img src='/img/2017/06/02.jpg'/>
  <p>
    At home, one of the first things I did was listening to my finds. The music
    I've found is mostly very
    traditional sounding Moroccan or Egyptian music. Not entirely what I
    hoped to find in the first place - in all honesty. There are a few singles
    which sound good to me like Robert Saghir's 'El Ayn Zergua'

    <sr>https://www.discogs.com/Robert-Saghir-El-Ayn-Zergua-Khaliouni-Maa-Hbibi/release/9618222</sr>,
    Abdelaziz Mahmoud - Chouf Chouf and the Nass El Ghiwane 7 inch

    <sr>https://www.discogs.com/%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%83/release/6584743</sr>. But the other singles... Most of them
    have either really poor recording quality, bear minimal amount
    of instrumentation and diversity to be even called a song in my opinion, or
    the vocals are mixed at least two times as loud as the instrumentation.
    It's probably not music that's made for me. I like my oriental music a bit
    more with either some beat or funky undertones in it. I'll try to add the releases
    that aren't on Discogs to Discogs. It's the least I can do.

  <p>
    Morocco is not an easy country to find music on vinyl in. You have to know
    exactly what you're looking for. Of course without much resources online and with
    almost none but the most popular of songs, being available digitally,
    it's hard to do any proper research. I took a wild random exploratory shotgun shot
    at finding music from Morocco and I know now how hard it really is. This
    journey gives me even more respect for the likes of labels like Radio
    Martiko, Habibi Funk and others, who are out in this field for many years.
    Eventhough the music is not entirely as I expected it to sound I've learned
    a lot about Morocco, it's country, the culture, the Ramadan,
    the heat and of course the haggling. Hopefully this article will serve
    useful to other crate diggers and future travellers.
