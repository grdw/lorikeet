  We're nearing the end of 2016 and what a year it has been.
  I hereby present to you, the list of lists of 2016, the top
  ten records I personally found to be the most enjoyable
  listens of this year. It's always hard to pick, but this has
  become the final list of lists (no backsies):
</p>

<h2>#10 - Heimat - Heimat</h2>
<div>
  <i>Kill Shaman</i>
</div>

  The first time I heard about this record was through the user
  'dyingforbadmusic' on Bandcamp. The weakness I have for great/bad cover
  art is rather telling and after seeing the above image I had to know
  what the hell this was going to sound like. Turns out it's a post-punk,
  sampler, cold, German baba ghanoush; and I like it!

<h2>#9 - Jean-Bernard Raiteux - Les Demons</h2>
<div>
  <i>Finders Keepers</i>
</div>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  One of the greatest record reissuing labels of the last time, hits
  again. This time with the movie soundtrack to Les Demons.
  It's occult, jazz, psychedelic, library music - to a rather explicit
  movie - is something for the odd balls out there. A horror movie about burning
  witches, corruption, torture, depravity, all the things you don't
  really want to see accompanied by a soundtrack you really want to hear.
  Confusing.

<h2>#8 - Hailu Mergia & Dahlak Band - Wede Harer Guzo</h2>
<div>
  <i>Awesome Tapes From Africa</i>
</div>
<p>

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  This is Hailu Mergia's magical keyboard and accordion playing combined
  with a fine band from Ethiopia, the Dahlak Band. If I
  have the story correct, Brian from Awesome Tapes Of Africa, got
  this tape from Hailu Mergia himself. It was the only tape currently
  in his possession and through that tape, this record was created.
  The music itself is relaxing, slow, lo-fi, jazzy, synthesiser music,
  which really explores the alienating sounds that come out of Ethiopia.

<h2>#7 - Klaus Johann Grobe - Spagat Der Liebe</h2>
<div>
  <i>Trouble In Mind</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/troubleinmind/klaus-johann-grobe-wo-sind" target="_blank">
    <img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/7.jpg"/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  The Follow up to 2014's 'Im Sinne Der Zeit' takes a funky disco take on rock
  music. To really cheaply put the 'krautrock' sticker on this record
  feels a bit to easy. The synth-heavy, German-sung songs make it hard
  to keep those feet from standing still. Catchy, funky, while still
  keeping a psychedelic vibe.

<h2>#6 - Loving - Loving</h2>
<div>
  <i>Haju Tapes</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://loving1.bandcamp.com/album/loving" target="_blank">
    <img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/6.jpg"/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Released on an instrumental hip-hop label and discovered by
  'Buried Muse', Loving's shimmering love songs are somewhat
  reminiscent of Mac de Marco's body of work. Tracks like "Forgot Again"
  and "Bowlly goes dancing drunk into the future" are really well
  written and sweet to listen to. It makes up a lot of listens
  on rainy Sunday afternoons and the cassette is proudly sitting on the
  shelf next to the others.

<h2>#5 - Omni - Deluxe</h2>
<div>
  <i>Trouble In Mind</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/deluxe" target="_blank">
    <img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/5.jpg"/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Omni's debut 'Deluxe' is without a doubt one of the finest post-punk
  records to come out this year. It's technically complex, weird, it's mixed
  really smudgy, a little bit in the red at times and overall intense.
  The shear speed and eerie subjects of the lyrics make this record a
  very enjoyable listen.

<h2>#4 - Yishak Banjaw - Love Songs Vol. 2</h2>
<div>
  <i>Teranga Beat</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://terangabeat.bandcamp.com/album/love-songs-vol-2" target="_blank">
    <img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/4.jpg"/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Due to political situations in Ethiopia at the time, Yishak Banjaw's home recorded
  Love Songs Vol. 2, was delayed from seeing the light of day in other parts of the
  world for 30 years. This psychedelic, otherworldly, groovy jazz record gives you
  an extra dimension of the music of Ethiopia. This release stands out in the
  whole diversity of Ethiopian music I've managed to hear so far, purely due to
  it's experimental and psychedelic nature.

<h2>#3 - Monster Rally's - Mystery Cove</h2>
<div>
  <i>Gold Robot</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://monsterrally.bandcamp.com/album/mystery-cove-lp" target="_blank">

<p>
  I started blogging about Monster Rally's endeavours
  <a href="http://kofferbaque.blogspot.nl/2011/09/introduction-to-monster-rally.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>
  back in 2011 when
  his first cassettes started to pop-up on bandcamp. Now his sound is
  more refined, more polished but it retains it's exotic, glistening
  subtle-glitchy tone. Mystery Cove makes it hard not to imagine that
  you're on an island trying to fetch a coconut from a palm tree.

<h2>#2 - Kikagaku Moyo - House In The Tall Grass</h2>
<div>
  <i>Guruguru Brain</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHrJAvNq_E" target="_blank">

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Kikagaku Moyo; I saw them live for the first time in Liverpool
  this year and my response was to buy this album. It's a dream
  pop, psychedelic record with really soothing guitar work and
  singing. It's a really sweet, chill, nice record which works
  like a good cup of tea to a stressful day.

<h2>#1 - The Caretaker - Everywhere At The End Of Time</h2>
<div>
  <i>History Always Favours The Winners</i>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlCKYeQFw3U&t=710s" target="_blank">
    <img class="cover" src="/img/2016/12/1.jpg"/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  This is the number one of 2016 for me; no questions asked. This record
  is an extensions to the ode The Caretaker is giving, to the ballroom
  scene of The Shining. He'll do another 5 albums of these and I can't
  wait to hear everyone of them. The mood, the overall vibe, the
  nostalgic feelings, the haunting beauty - it's all in here.
