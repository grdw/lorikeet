  To all the people on /r/vintageobscura (and people who read my blog) I'll be streaming live this coming
  Sunday December the 1st from 14:00 UTC till 18:00 UTC (that's 13:00 till 17:00 in the Netherlands). It will be a selection of new-age,
  free-jazz, african rhythms, rumba's, cumbia's and all sorts of vintage
  experimental oddities. I hope you'll enjoy it. Tracklists will be posted afterwards.

  <strong>
  You can listen to the live-stream through the front-page, so through: <a href="/">lorikeet.nl</a>
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  All the music will be streamed from physical records and tapes, no digital!
