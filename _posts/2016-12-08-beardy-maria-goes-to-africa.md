  Coming december the 16th I'll do a full African DJ set (vinyl only) in one of
  our local taverns called "De Odeon" in Alkmaar. As a little promotion I'll
  be doing an online live set this weekend on sunday from 13:00 - 17:00. Please
  tune in to my website and you'll hear the greatest Ethiopian jazz, crazy funk
  rhythms from Madagascar, Afro-cuban tracks from Angola, dance hits from Nigeria.
</p>

<p>
  The show on the 16th will be the last time I'll perform as 'Beardy Maria' and
  from then on I'll just use 'Lorikeet' as my DJ alias and stick with that for
  the time being.
</p>

<p>
  Until then, lots of love
</p>
