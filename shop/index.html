    Currently I've been selling close to 150 orders on Discogs and thought
    it would be nice to introduce people to the things I've been
    selling. All these items on this page, I'm giving away for free.
    (Read more by scrolling down).

    If you however want something collectable and special, than I'm
    probably selling it on Discogs:
  </p>

  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/seller/LorikeetRecords/profile" class="btn">More on Discogs!</a>
</div>

{% for item in site.data.free_music %}
  <div class="post pg">
    <strong>{{ item.artist }} - {{ item.title }}</strong>
    <ul class="tags">
      {% for tag in item.genre %}
        <li>{{ tag }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
{% endfor %}

    If you want any of these items, the following rules apply:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      All these items are free, so 0â‚¬/$/whatever.
    </li>
    <li>
      The max is two per person
    </li>
    <li>
      The shipment costs are the things you have to pay yourself,
      because I do support my local postal company.
    </li>
    <li>Don't be a dick:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If I find out that you only want these records so you can sell them yourself,
          than you are a dick.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you however - in time - find that the music is getting a bit
          boring, give them away to somebody else for free. That would
          make you a first class hero.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Send me an email: <a href="mailto:bird@lorikeet.nl">bird{at}lorikeet.nl</a>
    and tell me a little bit about why you want this
    record and where it needs to ship to. I'll send you a payment
    request through paypal for the shipment costs. If that's paid, I'll
    ship it and you can enjoy your free music. If you live in the direct
    neighborhood, know who I am and where I live, than you can obviously
    come and get it without any of the shipment costs.
